## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

[Ans: I have used one outside resource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQXEGTrWGnk]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

[Ans: Some of the challenges I had while doing this project was that these all languages were new to me, I have never worked with html,
css, and js but they were not complicated to have learn. Also this was my first time doing web developing and I would say it went really 
great. One challenge I faced was how to render gif directly in readme, I was trying to figure it out then I used youtube and found a way to 
it. Everything else was straight forward since the instructions were easy to follow.] 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[1-How do html, js, css get combined? Like how they get together, I know we used the same variable in languages but how are the language able to figure out what they have to do?
2-How would we able to add images to the button. 
3-Are we are going to do web developing in Codepath internship.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[Ans: I had midterm this week that's why I was not able to put alot of work into this project. But I think tried my best to finish it. If I had more time I would add images to the buttons, use different sounds, 
add amount of mistake user can make, and lastly, add more buttons.]
